## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Instructions
When testing backend APIs:
1. Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` agent for all backend testing
2. Test all endpoints thoroughly including authentication, CRUD operations, and error handling
3. Verify database connections and operations
4. Test role-based access control

### Frontend Testing Instructions
When testing frontend:
1. Ask user permission before testing frontend
2. Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` for UI/UX testing
3. Test responsive design on multiple screen sizes
4. Test dark/light theme switching
5. Test all navigation and form interactions

### Incorporate User Feedback
- Always ask user for feedback after major feature completion
- Get user approval before moving to next phase
- Document any changes requested by user

## Current Application Status
- **Backend**: Basic FastAPI server running with health check endpoint
- **Frontend**: React app with responsive design, theme switching, and basic navigation
- **Database**: MongoDB connection configured
- **Theme**: Light/dark mode implemented with proper color schemes
